      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a technologist, avid lifelong learner and logician. I love open source, technology platforms and improving our planet for everyone and everything.
Currently residing in the UK, I work at Microsoft as a Technology Strategist. There, I help Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s network of partners shape and build new products, solutions and services centred on Azure and Microsoft 365. But my primary focus is Azure.
Previously, I was a Technology Advocate at Hewlett Packard Enterprise where I founded a team that curated strategic alliances with technology companies across Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</description>
